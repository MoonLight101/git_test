    <h1>Links</h1>
    <p>This particular page is about links! There are three types of links:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Absolute links, like to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network</a>, which is a very good resource for web developers.</li>
        <li>Relative links, like to our <a href="./misc/extras.html">extras page</a>.</li>
        <!-- This won't work for our local HTML files -->
        <li>Root-relative links, like to <a href='/'>home page</a> of our website, but those aren't useful to us right now.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- The only difference between a root-relative link and a relative one is that the former(root-relative) starts with a forward slash. 
     That initial forward slash represents the root of your site. 
     You can add more folders and files to the path after that initial slash, just like relative links. 
     The following path will work correctly no matter where the current page is located (even in misc/extras.html): 

     /images.html -->

    <!-- Root-relative links are some of the most useful kinds of links. 
     They’re explicit enough to avoid the potential confusion of relative links, 
     but they’re not overly explicit like absolute links. 
     You’ll see a lot of them throughout your web development career, 
     especially in larger websites where it’s hard to keep track of relative references. -->
    
    
    <p>This example is about links and <a href="./images.html">images</a>.</p>

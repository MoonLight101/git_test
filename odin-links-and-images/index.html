        <!-- While href specifies the destination link, target specifies where the linked resource will be opened. -->
        <!-- _blank - new tab or window, _self - current tab -->
        <!-- rel=”noopener”: prevents the new tab from accessing the original page, ensuring security. -->
        <!-- rel=”noreferrer”: ensures the new page cannot see the referring page’s address (privacy) and prevents it from accessing the original page (security). -->
        <!-- it is recommended to always pair a target="_blank" with a rel="noopener noreferrer", using both noopener and noreferrer-->

        <!-- Absolute links
         Links to pages on other websites on the internet are called absolute links. 
         A typical absolute link will be made up of the following parts: scheme://domain/path. 
         An absolute link will always contain the scheme and domain of the destination. 
         Link above is an example of an absolute link.-->

        <!-- Relative links
        Links to other pages within our own website are called relative links. 
        Relative links do not include the domain name, since it is another page on the same site, 
        it assumes the domain name will be the same as the page we created the link on. -->

        <!-- Relative link example: -->
        <!-- By adding ./ you are specifying to your code that it should start looking for the file/directory relative to the current directory. -->
        <p><a href="./pages/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About</a></p>
        <p><a href="./pages/page-two.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Second page</a></p>

        <!-- Image link with relative path-->
        <!-- To access parent directory use "../" -->
        <!-- The alt attribute is used to describe an image. 
         It will be used in place of the image if it cannot be loaded. 
         It is also used with screen readers to describe what the image is to visually impaired users. -->
        <!-- It is a good habit to always specify width and height attributes on every image, even when the image is the correct size or you are using CSS to modify it. -->
        <img src="./img/dog.jpg" alt="Charles The Dog" height="600" width="400">
